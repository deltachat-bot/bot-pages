# How to Run a Delta Chat Bot

To run a bot, you don't need to be a programmer. 
You don't even need to own or rent a server.
A bot runs on any computer.

Any bot has a documentation about how to use it - you need to find this information.
ðŸš§ **TODO**: Where to find the bot's documentation?

## Internet Connection

For running any Delta Chat bot, there is one basic requirement: That a network connection to your email provider is possible via IMAP and SMTP.

## Install the Bot

Next, checkout the documentation of the bot of your choice.
You need an installation of the runtime (programming language) that the bot uses (e.g. Python or NodeJS), if you don't have that already.

## Every Bot Needs an Email Address

The bot's documentation will tell you if there is anything else to prepare.
For example, a Delta Chat bot always uses one or more email addresses.
The documentation specifies how to tell the bot about its email address and password.
After all, a Delta Chat bot is basically a special purpose email client.

Tip: choose an email provider that doesn't (or does only very liberally) filter, block or delay incoming or outgoing emails. With good email providers, messages reach the chat partners within a few seconds.

ðŸš§ **TODO**: Links with short descriptions to example bots once they're ready.
