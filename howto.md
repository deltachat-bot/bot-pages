# How to use

For running any Delta Chat bot, there is one basic requirement: That a network connection to your email provider is possible via IMAP and SMTP.

Next, checkout the documentation of the bot of your choice. You probably need an installation of the runtime that the bot uses (e.g. Python or NodeJS), but you might already have that.

The bots documentation will tell you if there is anything else to prepare, and how to tell it about its email address and password. Remember: a Delta Chat bot is basically an special purpose email client.

Tip: choose an email provider that doesn't (or does only very liberally) filter, block or delay incoming or outgoing emails. With good email providers, messages reach the chat partners within a few seconds.

ðŸš§ **TODO**: Links with short descriptions to example bots once they're ready.
