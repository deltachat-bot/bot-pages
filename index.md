# Delta Chat bots

Welcome! ðŸ¤–

## What is it?

Delta Chat bots are bridges into the world. They connect Delta Chat with general computing capabilities, mediated through emails. Often they connect to other chat protocols, or send and receive data to and from the web, but really there is no limit other than what a computer can do.

A Delta Chat bot only needs a running computer and a network connection. That might be a server in a data center, your laptop, a raspberry pi at home, or even a mobile phone at the camping ground. It does not need a publicly reachable IP-address or port, NATs are not an issue.

The bot doesn't even have to be connected all the time. It obviously can't read or send messages while offline, but it will resume doing so every time its connectivity is back.
