# Delta Chat bots

Welcome, human! ðŸ¤–

These pages describe Delta Chat bots, show real life examples and give helpful information for developing your own bots.


## What is it?

Bots are Delta Chat's bridges into the rest of the world. 
Bots can use a Delta Chat Message as an input for scripts, or they can send messages automated and auto-generated.
Typically they connect to other chat protocols, or fetch data from the web. 
Sometimes they are used for games.
But there is no limit - Delta Chat Bots could do everything a computer can do.

A Delta Chat bot only needs a running computer and a network connection. That might be:

* a server in a data center,
* your laptop,
* a raspberry pi at home,
* or even a mobile phone at the camping ground. 

Delta Chat Bots do not need a publicly reachable IP-address or port, NATs are not an issue.

The bot doesn't even have to be connected all the time. It obviously can't read or send messages while offline, but it will resume doing so every time its connectivity is back.
